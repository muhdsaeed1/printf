ALX Software Enginering Printf Team Project
This team project is a custom made printf function for the C programming language called _printf. It has been optimized to take various inputs and optional arguments based exactly on how the standard library function printf works. This is a cohort 9 project of the ALX school of software engineering.

Synopsis
This function _printf() writes output to stdout, the standard output stream with the format and options without making use of any of the standard library files. It was written to use a local buffer of 1024 bytes when printing although it can print larger sets of data.

The _printf() function returns the total number of characters printed to the stdout(excluding the null byte at the end of strings) after a successful execution.

If an output error is encountered, a negative value of -1 is returned.

The prototype of this function is: int _printf(const char format, ...);

This means that it has one mandatory format argument, and an extra number of arguments that can be none, or many.

Format of the format string

The format string is a character string starting and ending with double quotes. The format string is composed of zero or more directives; ordinary characters (not %), and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

Each conversion specification is introduced by the character % and ends with a conversion specifier. In between there may be (in this order):

Zero or more flags

An optional field width

An optional precision modifier

An optional length modifier

The flag characters

Flag	Description
#	For o conversions the first character of the output string is made zero (by prefixing a 0 if it was not zero already). For x and X conversions, a nonzero result has the string "0x" or "0X" respectively added.
0	(Not implemented yet) The value should be zero padded. For d, i, o, u, x, and X the converted value is padded on the left with zeros. If the 0 and - flags both appear,the 0 flag is ignored. If a precision is given with a numeric conversion, the 0 flag is ignored.
-	(Minus sign, not implemented yet) The converted value is to be left adjusted on the field boundary, (Default is right justification) and padded with blanks in the right rather than on the left with blanks or zeros. This flag overrides 0 if both are given.
' '	(Blank Space) The argument is padded with a single blank space before a positive number or empty string produced by a signed conversion.
+	A sign (+ or -) should always be placed before a number produced with a signed conversion. By default, only negative numbers have this sign.
The field width

An optional decimal digit string (with non-zero first digit) specifying a minimum field width. If the converted value has fewer characters than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on the left if the flag - is not present, and on the right if it is present. A character * can be used instead of a decimal string. In this case, an argument passed to the function will be taken as the width value.

printf("%5d", num);
or
printf("%*d", width, num);

The precision
An optional precision, in the form of a period ('.') followed by an optional decimal digit string. A negative precision is taken as if the precision were omitted. This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for d, i, o, u, x, and X conversions, or the maximum number of characters to be printed from a string for s and S conversions. A character * can be used instead of a decimal string. In this case, an argument passed to the function will be taken as the precision value.

printf("%.3d", num);
or

printf("%.*d", precision, num);
The length modifiers





Modifier	Description
l	An integer conversion to a long int or unsigned long int argument.
h	An integer conversion to a short int or unsigned short int argument.
The conversion specifier
Integer

Input: _printf("There are %i dozens in a gross\n", 12);
Output: There are 12 dozens in a gross
Character

Input: _printf("The first letter in the alphabet is %c\n", 'A');
Output: The first letter in the alphabet is A
String

Input: _printf("%s\n", 'This is a string.');
Output: This is a string.
Decimal:
Input: _printf("%d\n", 1000);
Output: 1000
Rot13

Input: _printf("Unknown:[%R]\n", "HELLO WORLD");
Output: URYYB JBEYQ

FLAGS
Input: printf("Flag: [%+ d]", 1230);
Output: Flag: [+1230] => 13

OCTAL
Input: printf("Unsigned octal:[%o]", 6);
Output: Unsigned octal:[6] => 18



Project Requirements
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and â€“pedantic

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c

Code must follow the Betty style
Global variables are not allowed
Authorized functions and macros:
write (man 2 write)
malloc (man 3 malloc)
free (man 3 free)
va_start (man 3 va_start)
va_end (man 3 va_end)
va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
va_arg (man 3 va_arg)




Mandatory Tasks
 Write function that produces output with conversion specifiers c, s, and %.
 Handle conversion specifiers    d, i.
 Create a man page for your function.

Advanced Tasks
 Handle conversion specifier  b.
 Handle conversion specifiers u, o, x, X.
 Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.
 Handle conversion specifier S.
 Handle conversion specifier p.
 Handle flag characters +, space, and # for non-custom conversion specifiers.
 Handle length modifiers l and h for non-custom conversion specifiers.
 Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.
 Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.
 Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
 Handle the custom conversion specifier  r that prints the reversed string.
 Handle the custom conversion specifier R that prints the rot13'ed string.
R- The argument received is expected to be a pointer  type char* to an array of characters. Characters from this array are encoded to ROT13 and printed in order up to (but not including a null byte ('\0').

 All above options should work well together.









File Descriptions
_printf.c
contains the fucntion _printf, which uses the prototype int _printf(const char *format, ...);. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. _printf will return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings) and will write output to stdout, the standard output stream.

_putchar.c
contains the function _putchar, which writes a character to stdout.
main.h *contains all function prototypes used for _printf.


man_3_printf
manual page for the custom _printf function.



functions.c functions1.c functions2.c
contains all function of each specifier used for _printf.
all function have its own description inside the file.
